          <h2>What lead to this?</h2>
          
           <p>

               When I was 17 I started working in the print industry with my granfather. He started a sign shop in the early 2000s to break away from factory work. He was able to teach himself photoshop and how to use other various design programs such as signlab and adobe illustrator. I was very interested in these programs and how i could use them to manipulate images and create something that i wasn't necessarily able to draw on paper with the same execution.
            </p>
            <p>    
               After i graduated from highschool and had worked several odd jobs I decided that i wanted to be a graphic designer and attended Nossi College of Art in 2015. One of the classes i took at Nossi was web design where i was exposed to html css, and javascript. i was instantly fond of it because it reminded me of myspace and how you could edit your page to be something completely different from the next user. Thus my interest for development had begun.

          <h2>Why be a software developer?</h2>
            <p id="inspiration">
                I want to be a developer because its a fun way to create. There are tons of frustrating moments but the trouble shooting is half the fun. its almost like a puzzle game. it also doesn't hurt that this is a lucrative career path.
